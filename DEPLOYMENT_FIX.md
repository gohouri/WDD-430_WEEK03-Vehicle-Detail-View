# ðŸš€ **Render Deployment Fix**

## **Issue**: Build script not found
The error shows: `npm error Missing script: "build"`

## **Solution 1: Update Render Build Command**

1. **Go to your Render Dashboard**
2. **Select your service**
3. **Go to Settings tab**
4. **Update Build Command to**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. **Keep Start Command as**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
6. **Add Environment Variable**:
   - Key: `NODE_ENV`
   - Value: `production`

## **Solution 2: Alternative Build Command**

If Solution 1 doesn't work, try this build command:
```bash
npm install && node data/init-db.js
```

## **Why This Works**

- The `postinstall` script in package.json will automatically run `node data/init-db.js` after `npm install`
- This initializes the database during the build process
- The server will start with the database already created

## **Steps to Fix**

1. **Update Render settings** (use Solution 1 above)
2. **Redeploy** your service
3. **Test** the classification pages

## **Expected Result**

After redeployment, all these URLs should work:
- âœ… https://wdd-430-week03-vehicle-detail-view.onrender.com/
- âœ… https://wdd-430-week03-vehicle-detail-view.onrender.com/inventory/classification/1
- âœ… https://wdd-430-week03-vehicle-detail-view.onrender.com/inventory/classification/2
- âœ… https://wdd-430-week03-vehicle-detail-view.onrender.com/inventory/classification/3
- âœ… https://wdd-430-week03-vehicle-detail-view.onrender.com/inventory/classification/4

The database will be automatically created with all vehicle data during the build process.
